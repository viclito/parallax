                                    Green tea is the most popular tea globally. It’s unoxidized and has less caffeine than black tea. Camellia sinensis leaves are picked, dried, and heat-treated to prevent oxidation. In China, people often pan-fire leaves, which creates a duller green color. In Japan, people will typically steam them and achieve a brighter green shade. Due to its composition, green tea has a multitude of health benefits for fighting viruses and preventing future health issues.

                                    Originating in India, chai tea is brewed with Camellia sinensis assamica leaves. Though it’s technically a black tea, chai tea has a specific flavor profile and preparation process that differentiates it. It’s typically brewed with warm milk, sugar, and aromatic spices like ginger and cinnamon. Like many black teas, it contains caffeine.

                    Oolong, or Wulong, tea is semi-oxidized and picked later in the season than green tea. The leaves come from the Camellia sinensis plant and are bruised by being tossed or shaken in baskets, which changes the oxidation process. They're heat-treated to stop oxidation, which can vary based on region and create different flavors. While oolong tea has less caffeine than black tea, it has more caffeine than green tea.

                The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C. robusta.[4] Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. As of 2018, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world's total.

                    Worldwide, experts estimate that people consume around 2.25 billion cups of coffee per day. Researchers have looked at the benefits of drinking coffee for conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and liver disease. There is evidence to support some, but not all, of these claims.

                    Coffee contains a number of useful nutrients, including riboflavin (vitamin B2), niacin (vitamin B3), magnesium, potassium, and various phenolic compounds, or antioxidants. Some experts suggest that these and other ingredients in coffee can benefit the human body in various ways.

                    This article looks at the possible health benefits of drinking coffee, the evidence supporting those benefits, and the risks of drinking coffee.

                        <h1 class="capsh1"> Got your required equipment? Let’s make French press coffee! This coffee method is extremely forgiving. The basic steps? Add the coffee, wait for 5 minutes, and plunge. Here’s what to do: <br>

                            1 --> Grind the coffee: Grind 70 grams (1 cup) coffee beans to a medium grind. The size of grind is important: if it’s too fine it can create sediment; if it’s too coarse it’s not flavorful enough. <br>
                            2 --> Heat the water: Heat 4 cups water to hot but not boiling (200 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit) using an electric kettle, or bring it to a boil on the stovetop and then let it sit for 1 minute to decrease in temperature. <br>
                            3 --> Add coffee grounds: Add the coffee grounds to the bottom of the pot. <br>
                            4 --> Let coffee bloom for 1 minute: Add hot water to the height of the coffee and stir with a spoon. Set a timer and wait for 1 minute. <br>
                            5 --> Add water and brew 4 minutes: Fill the French press to the top (just below the spout) and stir again. Set a timer and wait for 4 minutes. <br>
                            6 --> Plunge: Place the lid on the French press and slowly press the plunger all the way down. Serve immediately. (Tip: If the plunger is hard to press, use a more coarse grind of coffee the next time. If it presses very easily, make the coffee grounds a bit finer.)</h1>

                            How to make espresso with an espresso machine <br>
                            1 --> Grind the coffee: Use espresso roast coffee, about 9 grams for a single espresso shot and 18 grams for a double shot. Grind the coffee until it’s very fine ground. Different roasts and brands of beans will require a different grind for your machine. You may need to do a few test runs to get it dialed in just right.  <br>
                            2 --> Pack and tamp the coffee grounds: Add the coffee grounds to the espresso basket (portafilter) until it’s slightly heaping over the top. Use the tamper to press the grounds evenly into the portafilter, pressing very firmly until it is fully compressed. Place the portafilter on a folded towel before tamping, or the best tool is a knock box for tamping and discarding used grounds. It’s important for the coffee grounds to be as even and straight as possible to get the best espresso shot. <br>
                            3 --> Pull the shot: Place the portafilter in the espresso machine and press the button to pull the shot. Most home espresso machines have an automatic option for this. A well-pulled espresso shot will last around 25 to 30 seconds and have deep espresso flavor with a nice foamy crema. <br>
                            4 --> Consider any adjustments: It takes a while to dial in the fineness of the coffee grind and amount of coffee to use: practice makes perfect! If the shot is watery, use slightly more coffee grounds or a finer grind on the coffee. If a shot takes longer than 30 seconds, reduce the amount of coffee grounds or use a coarser grind on the coffee. <br>

                            1 --> Decide on your drink size. A 1-shot Americano can mostly fit in an espresso mug (shown here). A 2-shot drink is best suited in a latte mug. <br>
                            2 --> Make the espresso. Use espresso roast coffee to make espresso using your favorite method: with an automated espresso machine, manual espresso maker, or Aeropress. <br>
                            3 --> Boil the water. Use a regular or electric teapot to boil the water. The standard ratio is 2:1 water to espresso, but you can go up to as much as 3:1. <br>
                            4 --> Mix the two and enjoy! Pour the boiling water into the espresso. Instant Caffe Americano!
